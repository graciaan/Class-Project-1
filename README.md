## Description 

Sometimes with so many movies and shows, you would like a hand with it; this can take you several hours trying to figure out what to watch and when you see time, a lot of your free time is wasted; that's when a Random movie generator comes in handy; this project executes the functions by having two APIs, allowing a spontaneous suggestion for a film. We know that sometimes we have watched almost everything through a different platform, and with this (code), we can get a recommendation or multiple recommendations (if needed). Also, you could find movies by year as a preference with a selector function. You can then get the Movie name, Rate, release date description and picture even (the API rating or the rating according to our API); you can add it to your favourites if you like a movie using local storage.
